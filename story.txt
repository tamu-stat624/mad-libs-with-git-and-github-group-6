Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Niharika,

I am writing to you from a unique spaceship in a different galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a yellow rocket in September. There are 69 dolphins and teeth of a child zombie here! In the 420-A there is a pool full of [11]. I fall asleep each night on a [12] bed of
[13] and dream of [14] [15]. It feels as though I have lived here for
7 Hours. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
Playing Football on a breakable Porche!!

Best wishes,
Group Six
