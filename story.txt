Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear [1],

I am writing to you from a [2] spaceship in a [3] galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a [4] rocket in [5]. There are 69 dolphins and teeth of a child zombie here! In the 420-A there is a pool full of coke. I fall asleep each night on a tiny bed of
marble and dream of gaming hungrily. It feels as though I have lived here for
7 Hours. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
Playing Football on a breakable Porche!!


Best wishes,
Group Six
